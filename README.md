# Phishing-Website-Detection

This repository contains code for predicting phishing websites in a webpage phishing dataset using various machine learning models. We explored three different models: Random Forest, XGBoost, and Support Vector Machine (SVM).

#### Methodology:
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
2. Model Development
3. Model Saving

#### Dataset Used:
The dataset used for this project contains webpage phishing detection obtained from Kaggle

#### Usage:
To replicate the experiments or apply the trained model:
1. Obtain a similar dataset.
2. Follow the provided Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training.
3. Adjust parameters or algorithms as needed based on the specifics of your dataset.
4. Save the trained model using the provided code snippet with `pickle`.
5. Utilize the saved model for making predictions on new data.

#### Dependencies:
- Python 3
- Libraries: NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, scipy, pickle
